Little Thoughts

Little Thoughts is a small mobile application developed in react native for a univeristy cross-platform development module.

The app allows users to write diary entires as well as listen to music and make use of a pomodoro timer for help with studying.
There is also an account system which makes use of google firebase that allows users to create accounts which their diary entires will be saved to allowing for them to be accessed on other devices.
